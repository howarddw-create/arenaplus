<h1>Arena Plus Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: June 15, 2025</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Arena Plus ("we", "our", or "us") handles your information when you install and use the Arena Plus browser extension (the "Extension"). By using the Extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The Extension stores data locally in your browser through <code>chrome.storage.local</code>. This may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wallet addresses and encrypted private keys you enter in the Extension.</li>
  <li>Settings and feature preferences such as Focus Mode status or API keys.</li>
  <li>Temporary data needed to deliver functionality, such as the last token price fetched.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not automatically collect personal information from your device, and we do not sync your data to any external server.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wallet operations:</strong> Your wallet data is used only to process transactions you initiate on arena.social.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature settings:</strong> Local settings ensure the Extension behaves according to your preferences.</li>
  <li><strong>Network requests:</strong> When you request token prices or AI-generated replies, the Extension sends the necessary data (such as an Arena username or your API key) to third-party services like Stars Arena, DexScreener, or Google Generative AI. These requests occur only when triggered by you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell or rent your data. The Extension transmits your data only to the services listed above as needed to provide features. We do not share your personal information with advertisers or analytics providers.</p>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>Your wallet private keys are encrypted before being stored in <code>chrome.storage.local</code>, and any passwords are hashed using industry-standard techniques. Despite these measures, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We encourage you to safeguard your passwords and API keys.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>Data stored by the Extension remains in your browser until you remove it manually or uninstall the Extension. Clearing your browsing data may also remove stored information. We do not keep any copies of your data on our servers.</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Certain features rely on third-party APIs. These services have their own privacy practices, and their handling of your data is governed by their respective policies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stars Arena API</li>
  <li>DexScreener API</li>
  <li>Google Generative AI</li>
</ul>
<p>Requests to these services are made only to perform the actions you choose (e.g., fetching token prices or generating AI replies).</p>

<h2>7. Fair Usage</h2>
<p>The Extension is intended for personal use. We reserve the right to limit or restrict features that place excessive load on third-party APIs or otherwise violate their terms of service. Please use the Extension responsibly and in accordance with all applicable laws.</p>

<h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You may review or delete the data stored by the Extension at any time via the Extension’s settings or by clearing your browser storage.</li>
  <li>You may uninstall the Extension to stop all data collection and usage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The Extension is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

<h2>10. Updates to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Extension after updates means you accept the revised policy.</p>

<h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Extension’s data practices, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@arenaplus.example">support@arenaplus.example</a>.</p>

<p>By using the Extension, you consent to this Privacy Policy.</p>
